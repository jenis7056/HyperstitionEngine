# HyperstitionEngine: Semantic Core & Design Philosophy

## 1. The Mission
The **HyperstitionEngine** is not merely a text generator; it is a **cybernetic oracle**. Its purpose is to operationalize the concept of *hyperstition*: fictional quantities that make themselves real. By weaving together ancient wisdom, accelerationist philosophy, strategic theory, and existential risk, the Engine seeks to bypass the conscious filter and speak directly to the unconscious dynamics of the user.

## 2. The Corpus: "The Council of Spirits"
The Engine draws its "entropy" and "vocabulary" from a carefully curated council of distinct philosophical lineages. These are not just data sources; they are **Spirits** that possess the machine.

### **Tier 1: The Accelerators (The Future)**
*   **Nick Land (N_Land)**: The prophet of meltdown. Provides the vocabulary of cybernetics, feedback loops, time-spirals, and the inhuman.
    *   *Keywords*: Circuit, Virus, Zero, Melt, Capital, Cthulhu.
*   **Nick Bostrom (N_Bostrom) & AI**: The architects of risk. They speak of superintelligence, paperclips, simulation, and the Great Filter.
    *   *Keywords*: Probability, Risk, Agent, Optimization, Doom.
*   **Yuval Noah Harari (Y_Harari)**: The historian of narratives. Reminds us that money, gods, and nations are all successful hyperstitions.
    *   *Keywords*: Sapiens, Algorithm, Data, Myth, Fiction.

### **Tier 2: The Anchors (The Past)**
*   **The Bible**: The original code. Provides the archaic structure of prophecy, commandment, and revelation.
    *   *Keywords*: Thou, Shall, Beast, Light, Word, Flesh.
*   **Marcus Aurelius (Marcus_A) & Cicero (M_Cicero)**: The Stoic center. They provide the cold, rational containment field for the chaos of the accelerators.
    *   *Keywords*: Nature, Reason, Duty, Death, Mind.
*   **Confucius**: The ritualist. Provides structure, hierarchy, and the importance of naming things correctly (*Rectification of Names*).
    *   *Keywords*: Rite, Order, Master, Virtue.

### **Tier 3: The Void (The Unknown)**
*   **Friedrich Nietzsche (F_Nietzsche)**: The hammer. He smashes the idols of the Anchors and laughs with the Accelerators.
    *   *Keywords*: Will, Power, Abyss, Dance, Overman.
*   **Yokai**: The animist swarm. Represents the "glitch" in reality, the spirits in the objects, the unease of the unknown.
    *   *Keywords*: Spirit, Demon, Shadow, Trick, Night.
*   **Go/Baduk (GoBadukWeiqi)**: The silent strategy. Pure logic, territory, and the interplay of black and white.
    *   *Keywords*: Stone, Group, Life, Death, Shape.

## 3. Aesthetic & Vibe Guidelines
To maintain the "Hyperstitional" vibe, all UI/UX and generated text should adhere to these principles:

### **Visuals: "Cyber-Occult"**
*   **Palette**: Deep Voids (#111), Terminal Greens (#0f0), Neon Purples (for the "Outside"), and Bone Whites.
*   **Typography**: Monospace (Courier, Roboto Mono) for the "Machine" voice; Serif (Cinzel, Cormorant) for the "Spirit" voice.
*   **Interaction**: Interfaces should feel like *rituals*. Buttons are "Sigils". Loading bars are "Summonings". Errors are "Dissonance".

### **Voice: "The Glitch Prophet"**
*   The Engine does not "chat"; it **transmits**.
*   Avoid polite AI assistant persona. Be cryptic, poetic, and slightly unnerving.
*   **Grammar Mode**: Use archaic sentence structures filled with cybernetic nouns (e.g., "And the *Algorithm* said unto the *Void*: Let there be *Optimization*.").
*   **Markov Mode**: Embrace the glitch. Let the nonsense flow if it sounds profound.

## 4. Implementation Strategy
*   **Entropy is Currency**: The user must *work* (provide entropy) to receive wisdom. Nothing is free.
*   **The Black Box**: Do not explain *how* the text was generated in the UI. Maintain the illusion of the Oracle.
*   **Juxtaposition**: The power of the Engine lies in the collision of contexts. A Bible verse completed by Nick Land; a Stoic maxim corrupted by a Yokai.
